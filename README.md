## <a id="intro">Introduction</a>

The purpose of this task is to successfully land and control a rover on the surface of Pluto using two Telerobotics principles (visual feedback and data compression). Tech stack for this mission is ReactJS along with node-sass for light control room styling.

- The New Horizon Rover (here-on "NHR") will always land at 0 0 N
- NHR can receive and execute four commands:
-- F = move forward;
-- B = move backward;
-- L = turn left 90ยบ;
-- R = turn right 90ยบ;
- NHR can be controlled both by on-screen buttons as well as their respective keyboard buttons;
- All commands sent are logged in the Command Log;
- NHR will hold position when faced with an obstacle;
- NHR will send warning message when holding position due to obstacle.

---

	yarn clean

Deletes the `build` and `node_modules` folders.

---
